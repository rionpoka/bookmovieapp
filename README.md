# bookmovieapp

This project is aimed at developing the front end of a real-world application in React. With this application, which is named BookMyMovie, users can browse upcoming and released movies; filter released movies based on certain parameters; and view details such as genre, artists and trailer of released movies.

Also, registered users can book a show for a released movie. In the corporate world, you are required to work on projects where you cannot build everything from scratch. If you do that, it is more like you are reinventing the wheel.
